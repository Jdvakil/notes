# Calculus

## Derivatives

- Function of a real variable (x,y,z,...) that measures the sesnitivity to change of the function value/output WRT the argument/input.
- The derivative of a function `f(x)` is the slope of the tangent of the function `f(x)` at a given `x`


## Gradient

> A gradient is the direction of the steepest ascent

- Gradients take the partial derivative of a function WRT each dimension.

## Back-propagation algorithm

> Essential for learning + training large neural networks. 

- A simple neural network has one input and one output node and hidden layers of multiple nodes. The nodes are connected with weights <em> w<sub>ij</sub> </em>, these weights are the network parameters. 

### Activation function

- Each node has a input `x`, an activation function `f(x)` and an output `y = f(x)`. `f(x)` has to be non-linear for the neural network to learn non-linear models. 

- An example of an activation function: $\frac{1}{1 + e <sup> -x </sup>}$

### Error function

- The goal is to learn the weights of the network from data such that the predicted output *y<sub>output</sub>*, is as close to the target *y<sub>target </sub>* for all inputs *x<sub>input</sub>*.

- To measure how far we are from the goal we use *E* (error function): $\frac{1}{2}$(*y<sub>output</sub>* - *y<sub>target</sub>*)<sup>2</sup>


### Forward propagation

- We take an example (*y<sub>output</sub>*, (*y<sub>output</sub>*) and update the input layer of the table. The input node is like any node but without an activation function. So therefore, its output is equal to its input => *y<sub>1</sub>* = *x<sub>input</sub>*

- After updating the input node, we move to the first layer. We take the output *y* of the previous node and use the weight to compute the input *x* of the next node.

> `x`<sub>`next`</sub>  = `w`<sub>`prev`</sub> * `y`<sub> `prev`</sub> + `b`<sub>`next`</sub>
> 
> `y = f(x)` 
>

- Using the two formulas above, we propagate for the rest of the network and get the final output. 

### Error derivative

- The backpropagation algorithm decides how much to update each weight of the network after comparing the predicted output with the desired output. 

- To compute how the error changes WRT each weight: $\frac{dE}{dw}$

> *w<sub>ij</sub> = w<sub>ij</sub> - $\alpha$ $\frac{dE}{dw}$*
>
> $\alpha$ is a positive constant which is the learning rate which needs to be fine-tuned empirically.

### Back propagation 

- If we have the predicted output of this particular input example, we can compute how the error changes with the output.
