# Keywords
- Classification model: A model that predicts members of a class (binary or multiclass)
- Clustering: Grouping related examples (used during unsupervised learning)
- Model: A mathematical construct that takes an input, processes, and returns an output
- Policy: An agent's probabilistic mapping from states to actions
- Regression model: A model that generates a numerical ouput
- Reinforcement learning: A model that works on reward and penalties for actions performed. Goal is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes reward
- Reward: A mathematical unit given to RL based models for actions performed
- Supervised learning: A model that takes a dataset with correct answers as an input and predicts a model output
- Training: The process of determining ideal parameters for the model (weights and biases)
- Unsupervised learning: A model that takes a dataset with no correct answers labeled. Model clusters meaningful patterns. 
- Example: Values that make up a dataset
- Feature: The input variables of an example
- Inference: Deployment of an evaluated model
- Label: The output/result of the features of an example
- Loss: The difference between the predicted value vs the actual value
