# Framing 
How to frame a problem as a ML problem.
- Label: a variable we are predicting (`y`) -- a simple linear regression. 
    - Could be the future price of wheat, image classification, etc...
- Feature: Input variables that describe the data (x<sub>1</sub>...x<sub>n</sub>)
    - Could include words in an email, senders address, time, etc...
- Example: Particular example of data `x`
- Labeled example: Used to train a model (`x`, `y`)
    - Includes both features and labels 
    - Needs explicit marking for the prediction
        - Spam detector: needs marking for spam or not spam
- Unlabled example: Used for making predictions on new data
    - Has features but no labels. 
- Model: Maps example to predicted labels. Defines the relationship between features and label. 
    - **Training**: Creating or learning the model, you show the model labeled examples and enable the model to gradually learn the relationships between features and label. 
    - **Inference**: Applying the trained model to unlabeled examples. You use the trained model to make useful predictions. 
- Regression vs Classification
    - **Regression**: Predicts numerical value.
    - **Classification**: Predicts discrete value.
- Linear regression: A method for finding the straight line or hyperplane that best fits a set of points.
    - Linear relationship: `y = mx + b`
        - `y`: value to be predicted
        - `m`: slope of a line
        - `x`: value of input
        - `b`: y-intercept
    - `y' = b + wx`
        - `y'`: predicted label
        - `w`: weight vectors
        - `b`: bias
- Loss: L<sub>2</sub> or squared error takes the square of prediction and actual delta.
